This application is meant to be used as a starting place for those\r\nlooking to get their feet wet with ZF2.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nUsing Composer (recommended)\r\n----------------------------\r\nThe recommended way to get a working copy of this project is to clone the repository\r\nand use `composer` to install dependencies using the `create-project` command:\r\n\r\n    curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php --\r\n    php composer.phar create-project -sdev --repository-url=\"http://packages.zendframework.com\" zendframework/skeleton-application path/to/install\r\n\r\nAlternately, clone the repository and manually invoke `composer` using the shipped\r\n`composer.phar`:\r\n\r\n    cd my/project/dir\r\n    git clone git://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication.git\r\n    cd ZendSkeletonApplication\r\n    php composer.phar self-update\r\n    php composer.phar install\r\n\r\n(The `self-update` directive is to ensure you have an up-to-date `composer.phar`\r\navailable.)\r\n\r\nAnother alternative for downloading the project is to grab it via `curl`, and\r\nthen pass it to `tar`:\r\n\r\n    cd my/project/dir\r\n    curl -#L https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication/tarball/master | tar xz --strip-components=1\r\n\r\nYou would then invoke `composer` to install dependencies per the previous\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nUsing Git submodules\r\n--------------------\r\nAlternatively, you can install using native git submodules:\r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication.git --recursive\r\n\r\nVirtual Host\r\n------------\r\nAfterwards, set up a virtual host to point to the public/ directory of the\r\nproject and you should be ready to go!\r\n>>>>>>> zend/master\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1894}]],"length":1894}
